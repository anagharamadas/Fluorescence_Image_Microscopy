This project explores the application of generative AI in the field of fluorescence microscopy by generating synthetic images to enhance the quality and quantity of microscopic image datasets. The study leverages the Pix2Pix model, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, to evaluate the efficiency of an existing input type and investigate the potential of a novel input type.

### Key Objectives

1. Generate synthetic fluorescence microscopy images using two distinct types of input images.

2. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Pix2Pix model in generating high-quality synthetic images.

3. Address data availability challenges in the medical domain by expanding datasets through generative AI.

4. Validate a newly published dataset of white blood cell microscopic images using a supervised model with two different input types.

### Methodology

- Data
  - We experiement this approach of generating synthetic images using two types of input data.
  - Approach 1: Input Brightfield Images to generate fluorescence images
  - Approach 2: Input Masked Fluorescence images where all channels except 1 will be masked in the input images. Here the channels are masked randomly, which means different input images will have a random combination of 5 out of 6 channels masked. The output fluorescence image generated will have all 6 channels that were input to the model.
